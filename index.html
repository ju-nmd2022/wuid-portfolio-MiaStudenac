<p> Hi there! My name is Mia and I'm a New Media Design student,<br> starting from this semester. I come from Croatia and I graduated there <br> as a graphic designer. I've worked in many programs so far and I wish <br> to work in many more. 
 I applied for JU to become a UX/UI designer. </p>
 <p> I think I will personally enjoy this programme a lot, as I already <br> enjoyed it so far. 
 Here are some fun facts about me. Such as: listening <br>to the music is what I do everytime I am outside, video games <br> are my comfort and happiness, aesthetics are something I need to have <br> around my place, I love cats even though I am allergic <br> to them and I am a former dancer.  </p>

<h1>Princess Mononoke</h1>

    <p>The tale of Princess Mononoke is a fantasy adventure: an epic struggle between humanity and nature. The story's competing interests-- comprised of cursed monsters, an assortment of people driven by ambition, a selfless hero, and vengeful gods--are remarkable in that there is no villain, instead portraying darkness and hate as it manifests in everyone.
    <br>This is a minimalistic poster inspired by the movie. The illustration represents one of the main characters and the movie is mostly recognized by that character. </p>
